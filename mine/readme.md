#  Parts for My Deluxe Fancy Keyboard

Here are all the parts I need printed for my Charybdis Nano (3x5) keyboard.  2 of these pices still need to be mirrored - I found a utility online to do the first one, but it didn't like the other two.  They are called out by file name.

File Listing

This listing of parts is taken from the [3d print cases section](https://github.com/Bastardkb/Charybdis/blob/main/readme.md#3d-prints---cases) of the Github resources.
